    "**Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method for regression tasks that constructs multiple decision trees during training. The predictions from these trees are averaged to produce a single output. This method combines the strengths of multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and control overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by:\n",
    "1. **Bootstrapping (Bagging):** Training each decision tree on a different random subset of the training data. This reduces the variance by ensuring that individual trees do not see the same data.\n",
    "2. **Feature Randomness:** When constructing each tree, a random subset of features is chosen at each split. This further decorrelates the trees and prevents them from being too similar, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Random Forest Regressor, the predictions from multiple decision trees are aggregated by averaging. For a given input, each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the final output of the ensemble is the average of these predictions. This averaging process helps to smooth out the predictions and reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "1. **n_estimators:** The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "2. **max_depth:** The maximum depth of each tree.\n",
    "3. **min_samples_split:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "4. **min_samples_leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "5. **max_features:** The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "6. **bootstrap:** Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.\n",
    "7. **random_state:** A seed used by the random number generator for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "- **Ensemble vs. Single Model:** Random Forest Regressor uses an ensemble of multiple decision trees, while Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Variance Reduction:** Random Forest reduces variance by averaging the predictions of multiple trees, whereas a single decision tree is more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** Random Forest is more robust to noise and overfitting due to its averaging mechanism, while a single decision tree may fit noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy:** Typically provides better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting:** Less likely to overfit due to the averaging of multiple trees.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance:** Provides insights into feature importance.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** Robust to outliers and noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Computationally Intensive:** Training and predicting can be slower and require more memory due to the large number of trees.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** The model is more complex and harder to interpret than a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value, which is the average of the predictions made by all the trees in the forest for a given input. This output represents the estimated value of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Random Forest can be used for classification tasks. When used for classification, it is referred to as a Random Forest Classifier. The main difference is in the aggregation method:\n",
    "- **Classification:** The final prediction is determined by majority voting among the trees, where each tree votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is the final prediction.\n",
    "- **Regression:** The final prediction is the average of the predictions from all the trees."
